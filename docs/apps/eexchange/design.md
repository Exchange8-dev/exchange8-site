# eExchange (Exchange8 Trading App) - Detailed Design Document

> Wire-level design for the Exchange8 Flutter app `apps/eexchange`.
> Overview: `README.md`. Business functionality: `BUSINESS.md`.

## 1. Scope & Context

**Owns:**

- The Flutter presentation layer for the Exchange8 trader/ops surfaces:
  `main.dart` (bootstrap), `shell/app_shell.dart` (navigation +
  `BffClientScope`), `bff/bff_client.dart` (client façade, scope map,
  SSE surface, client-side caches), `pages/` (blotter, order entry,
  depth ladder, tape, ops).
- The app-local caches (`order_cache`, per-symbol books, per-symbol
  tapes) fed by SSE and read by pages.
- The app's BFF channel map (`/proxy/exchange8/v1/*` paths and
  `/subscribe/exchange8/*` topics as consumed by the pages).

**Does NOT own (delegated):**

| Concern | Owner |
|---|---|
| HTTP + SSE transport, OAuth bootstrap, token custody | `sdk/flutter/sentin8_flutter` (`Bff8ApiClient`) |
| Token issuance, session, step-up authentication | Sentin8:Auth (via BFF) |
| Token exchange/down-scoping, proxy routing, tenant resolution | Sentin8:BFF |
| Order matching, books of record, market data | Exchange8 services (gateway, me, md) |
| Halts, busts, surveillance cases | Exchange8 services (gateway/clearing, surveillance) |
| Admin surfaces (market-state wall, cascade, sessions, feeds) | Sentin8:Dash RFW pages (per-service `/v1/admin/ui/*`) |
| App-Store listing contract | `app-listing.json` → Sentin8:App |

**System context** - the app sits at the platform edge; the trust
boundary is the device edge. Everything past `Bff8ApiClient` is a
BFF-proxied call carrying the user's session (never a raw service token):

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph trust["Device (untrusted)"]
        APP["eExchange Flutter app"]
    end
    APP -- "HTTPS session cookie<br/>HTTP /proxy/exchange8/v1/*" --> BFF["Sentin8:BFF"]
    APP -- "SSE /subscribe" --> BFF
    subgraph platform["Sentin8 platform (trusted)"]
        BFF -- "delegated tokens" --> GW["Exchange8:Gateway"]
        BFF --> MD["Exchange8:MD"]
        BFF --> CL["Exchange8:Clearing"]
        BFF --> SV["Exchange8:Surveillance"]
        BFF --> MB["Exchange8:ME / OMS"]
    end
```

**Container view** - internal module grouping (presentation / client / transport):

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph presentation["Presentation (pages)"]
        BL["blotter.dart"]
        OE["order_entry.dart"]
        DL["depth_ladder.dart"]
        TP["tape.dart"]
        OP["ops.dart"]
    end
    subgraph appclient["App client layer"]
        SH["shell/app_shell.dart<br/>BffClientScope + navigation"]
        FC["bff/bff_client.dart<br/>façade: get/post/subscribe + caches"]
    end
    subgraph transport["Platform transport"]
        TF["sdk/flutter/sentin8_flutter<br/>Bff8ApiClient (auth, HTTP, SSE)"]
    end
    BL -- "read stream + cache" --> FC
    OE -- "POST orders" --> FC
    DL -- "read stream + cache" --> FC
    TP -- "read stream + cache" --> FC
    OP -- "POST halt/bust + GET alerts" --> FC
    SH -- "provides scope" --> FC
    BL -- "consume" --> TF
    OE -- "consume" --> TF
    FC -- "wraps" --> TF
```

## 2. Runtime Architecture

The app runs a single widget tree. `main()` boots `EExchangeApp`
(MaterialApp, Royal Gold seed, Inter font) whose home is `AppShell`.
`AppShell` holds the navigation index and constructs the one
`Bff8ApiClient` façade, exposing it via `BffClientScope`; pages resolve it
with `BffClientScope.of(context)`. Each page is either a `StreamBuilder`
over an SSE channel (blotter, depth, tape), a form posting to the BFF
(order entry, bust), or a `FutureBuilder` over a GET (alerts list).

**Component view:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph ui["Widgets"]
        MAIN["EExchangeApp (MaterialApp)"]
        SHELL["AppShell"]
        PAGES["BlotterPage · OrderEntryPage · DepthLadderPage · TapePage · OpsPage"]
    end
    subgraph facade["bff_client.dart"]
        API["Bff8ApiClient (app façade)<br/>get · post · subscribe"]
        ORD["order_cache: Map cl_ord_id → OrderRow"]
        BOOK["books: Map symbol → _Book"]
        TAPES["tapes: Map symbol → List _Print"]
        ERR["BffError"]
        EV["BffEvent"]
        ROW["OrderRow"]
        SCOPEW["BffClientScope (InheritedWidget)"]
    end
    MAIN --> SHELL
    SHELL --> PAGES
    SHELL -- "creates + scopes" --> API
    PAGES -- "BffClientScope.of" --> SCOPEW
    API --> ORD
    API --> BOOK
    API --> TAPES
```

**Request lifecycle - order submission (mutation family):**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant U as Trader
    participant OE as OrderEntryPage
    participant API as Bff8ApiClient (façade)
    participant BFF as Sentin8:BFF
    participant GW as Exchange8:Gateway

    U->>OE: fill symbol/side/qty/limit/TIF
    OE->>OE: build map (cl_ord_id, side, qty, tif,…)
    OE->>API: post /proxy/exchange8/v1/orders
    API->>BFF: HTTP POST + session
    alt rejected (auth/risk/validation)
        BFF-->>API: 4xx error envelope
        API-->>OE: throws BffError(message)
        OE-->>U: inline red error text
    else accepted
        BFF->>GW: delegated call (exchange8:gateway:orders:write)
        GW-->>BFF: ack (order live/resting)
        BFF-->>API: 2xx
        OE-->>U: ticket stays, error cleared
    end
```

**Request lifecycle - market data consumption (subscription family):**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant DL as DepthLadderPage / TapePage
    participant API as Bff8ApiClient (façade)
    participant BFF as Sentin8:BFF
    participant MD as Exchange8:MD

    DL->>API: subscribe /subscribe/exchange8/md/EX8A
    API->>BFF: SSE GET /subscribe (exchange8:md:*:read)
    BFF->>MD: subscribe server-side
    MD-->>BFF: snapshot join, then deltas
    BFF-->>API: SSE events (book/tape JSON)
    API-->>DL: Stream BffEvent (StreamBuilder)
    DL-->>DL: render cache view (BBO, ladder, prints)
    Note over API,BFF: transport outage → stream error → page shows last-known cache<br/>re-subscribe on rebuild
```

## 3. Data Model

The app owns **no server tables**. Its "data model" is client-side,
in-memory, façade-owned and rebuilt from SSE on app start:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    BFF8APICLIENT ||--|| ORDER_CACHE : owns
    BFF8APICLIENT ||--|| BOOKS : owns
    BFF8APICLIENT ||--|| TAPES : owns
    ORDER_CACHE ||--o{ ORDER_ROW : "keyed by cl_ord_id"
    BOOKS ||--o{ BOOK : "per symbol"
    TAPES ||--o{ PRINT_LIST : "per symbol"
    BOOK ||--|{ LEVEL : "asks (best first)"
    BOOK ||--|{ LEVEL : "bids (best first)"
    PRINT_LIST ||--o{ PRINT : "tradeId, price, qty"

    ORDER_ROW {
        string clOrdId "blotter key"
        string status "live lifecycle"
        int qty
        int limitRaw "null = market"
        int tsUs "sort key"
    }
    BOOK {
        string bbo "best bid / ask label"
    }
```

- `orderCache: Map<String, OrderRow>` - keyed by `cl_ord_id`; sorted by
  `ts_us` at render time (newest first), never stored pre-sorted.
- `_Book` per symbol - `asks`/`bids` lists of `_Level(price, qty)`, BBO
  label best-of-list (`'-'` for a side with no levels).
- `_Print` - trade id, price, qty; render-capped at the latest 50.
- Persistence: none. Server state lives in Exchange8 schemas (`gateway.*`,
  `me.*`, `md.*` - owned by the respective services, out of scope); the
  client is a pure projection that refills from SSE snapshot joins.

## 4. API Surface

The app owns no server-side API; the contract below is what it **consumes**
(wire shapes per owning service's `DESIGN.md`.

| Audience | Call (via façade) | Contract | Gate (scope) | App behavior |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Trader | `POST /proxy/exchange8/v1/orders` | map: `cl_ord_id`, `symbol`, `side`, `qty`, `limit_raw?`, `tif` | `exchange8:gateway:orders:write` | error inline; blotter updates via SSE |
| Trader | SSE `subscribe('/subscribe/exchange8/orders')` | order lifecycle deltas | `exchange8:gateway:orders:read` | blotter rows update |
| Trader | SSE `subscribe('/subscribe/exchange8/md/{symbol}')` | snapshot join + book/tape deltas | `exchange8:md:marketdata:read`, `exchange8:md:snapshot:read` | ladder + tape render |
| Ops | `POST /proxy/exchange8/v1/admin/instruments/{symbol}/state` | `{status: H\|O}` halt/resume | admin scope (exchange8:gateway admin set) | result text per button |
| Ops | `POST /proxy/exchange8/v1/trades/bust` | `{trade_id}` | `exchange8:clearing:trades:*` (step-up enforced server-side) | result text |
| Ops | `GET /proxy/exchange8/v1/surveillance/cases` | case list (`detector`, `severity`) | surveillance read scope | alert list |

**Event flow the app participates in** (client is a pure SSE consumer -
no outbox of its own; the server outbox → Bus chain belongs to each
service's design):

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant EX as Exchange8 service (me/gateway/md)
    participant BUS as Sentin8:Bus
    participant BFF as Sentin8:BFF
    participant APP as eExchange (façade caches)

    EX->>BUS: domain event (outbox relay)
    BUS-->>BFF: subscribe push
    BFF-->>APP: SSE /subscribe/exchange8/{channel}
    APP->>APP: cache write (order/book/tape)
    APP-->>APP: StreamBuilder rebuild
    Note over EX,BUS: exactly-once server-side (outbox + idempotency)<br/>client is at-least-once, cache upserts converge
```

## 5. Cross-Cutting Concerns

- **Authentication/token verification** - not in-app. The platform transport
  (`sdk/flutter/sentin8_flutter` `Bff8ApiClient`) owns sign-in, session
  cookie, and refresh against Sentin8:Auth via the BFF; the app never sees
  a token. Pages assume an authenticated scope from bootstrap.
- **Tenant resolution / tenancy** - the BFF resolves org/env from the
  session and sets RLS context on the called service; the app sends no
  `env_id` and never selects tenants itself (org-env picker is a shell
  concern of the platform library).
- **Authorization** - decided server-side (Shield per service). The app's
  scope map is a UI-gating hint only; a page neither assumes nor enforces
  authorization.
- **Idempotency** - order submission is idempotent on `cl_ord_id` (gateway
  dedupe). SSE events are at-least-once; façade cache writes are key
  upserts so replays converge.
- **Failure surfacing** - every mutation path catches `BffError` and
  renders the message inline; SSE failures surface as last-known caches,
  never as crashes.
- **TLS posture** - device→BFF always HTTPS, post-quantum TLS terminated at
  Sentin8:Proxy; the app participates by never disabling certificate
  validation.

**Authorization & error path (mutation):**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Page action (submit / bust / halt)"] --> B["façade POST via platform transport"]
    B --> C{BFF/auth OK?}
    C -- "no (401/403/5xx)" --> E["catch BffError"]
    E --> F["inline error text"]
    C -- yes --> D{Service accept?}
    D -- "no (risk/validation reject)" --> F
    D -- yes --> G["success state (200)"]
    F --> H[User edits and retries]
```

## 6. Failure Modes & Recovery

| Failure path | Behavior | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| BFF HTTP 4xx/5xx on mutation | `BffError` thrown → page `catch` → inline message | user corrects + resubmits |
| Network drop during POST | transport throws → same client path | retry with same `cl_ord_id` is safe (idempotent) |
| SSE stream breaks (BFF restart, network) | `StreamBuilder` sees error/done; caches stay last-known | page re-mount/re-subscribe; snapshot join refills book/tape |
| Order/bust rejected (risk, validation) | error envelope message displayed | no cache mutation - rejected orders never enter the blotter |
| Token/session expiry | transport surfaces error on next call | platform shell re-authenticates (sign-in flow) |
| App relaunch | caches empty | SSE snapshot joins + GET-backed pages refill; no persistence by design |

**Transport outage / re-subscribe loop:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[SSE stream active] --> B{Stream error/done?}
    B -- no --> C[render cache view]
    B -- yes --> D[page sees last-known cache]
    D --> E{Platform transport reconnects?}
    E -- "yes (retry with backoff)" --> F[re-subscribe channels]
    F --> G[snapshot join refill]
    G --> A
    E -- "no (auth expired)" --> H[sign-in flow via shell]
```

## 7. Concurrency & Performance Model

Single isolate (UI thread) - no background isolates: workloads are bounded
JSON decode + list slicing. Flutter drives rendering; the façade is a
synchronous cache with async I/O at the boundary:

- `orderCache`, `_books`, `_tapes` are plain `Map`s mutated on the UI
  isolate only (SSE events land via the platform transport on the same
  isolate) - no locks needed.
- Render caps: ladder shows top 10 levels per side; tape renders the
  latest 50 prints; blotter renders the bounded live-order map.
- SSE events rebuild pages via per-page `StreamBuilder`; one subscription
  per visible page, no shared broadcast fanout in-app.
- Backpressure: SSE is push; client writes are O(1) key upserts, tape
  windows are bounded by the render cap on read (older prints drop out).

**Task/channel topology (Flutter isolate + streams):**

```mermaid
graph LR
    SSE["SSE (transport)"] -- "events" --> SB1["StreamBuilder blotter"]
    SSE -- "events" --> SB2["StreamBuilder depth"]
    SSE -- "events" --> SB3["StreamBuilder tape"]
    SB1 --> OC[("order_cache")]
    SB2 --> BK[("books")]
    SB3 --> TP[("tapes")]
    OC --> UI1["ListView render"]
    BK --> UI2["Ladder render"]
    TP --> UI3["Tape render"]
    POST["POST (transport)"] -- "Future" --> FUT["FutureBuilder / await"]
    FUT --> UI4["Ops / ticket result"]
```

## 8. Invariants, Insecure-Defaults Rejected, Unsafe Rationale

Invariants (always true):

1. Exactly one `Bff8ApiClient` façade per widget tree, provided by
   `BffClientScope`; pages never construct clients.
2. All backend access goes through the BFF paths in §4 - no direct service
   host may ever appear in app code.
3. No OAuth token, session key, or FIX credential is stored, logged, or
   persisted in the app.
4. Façade caches are written only by SSE handlers inside the façade;
   pages read-only.
5. Blotter keys are unique `cl_ord_id`s; a repeated event for the same key
   is an overwrite (idempotent upsert), never a duplicate row.
6. Mutation failures surface as inline UI text, never as unhandled
   exceptions or navigation away from user input.
7. Market-data render slices are bounded (10 levels, 50 prints) regardless
   of cache growth.

Insecure defaults rejected:

- Direct service HTTPS from the app (bypassing BFF) - rejected: leaks
  topology and forces client-side token custody.
- Persisting the session/token in local storage - rejected; custody stays
  with the platform transport and session cookie.
- Client-side authorization as the only gate - rejected; scopes are
  re-decided server-side on every call (Shield).
- WebSocket for depth/tape - rejected: unnecessary bidirectional transport
  for one-way subscriptions.

No `unsafe` constructs exist (Dart/Flutter app; no FFI, no platform
channels in app code).

## 9. Testing Strategy

- **Widget tests** (`test/` - pending): page rendering with a faked
  `Bff8ApiClient` injected via `BffClientScope` - form submit posts the
  expected body; SSE-fed caches render as ladder/tape/blotter rows; error
  envelopes render inline rather than throwing.
- **Golden tests** (pending): design-system conformance (Royal Gold
  accent, Inter, glass panels) per `sentin8-design-system.md`.
- **Platform unit tests** - façade logic (cache upsert, BBO label, sort
  order) is pure Dart and unit-testable without widgets.
- **E2E UI suite** (`exchange8/e2e-ts`, Playwright, UI-only, BFF-proxied -
  never direct DB/backend): sign-in → order entry → blotter sees the order
  → depth/tape render from sim fills → bust (step-up) → alerts list. This
  suite owns app verification against the live BFF; widget tests do NOT
  replicate integration.
- **Deliberately NOT tested here:** server-side scope enforcement, SSE
  fanout, matching semantics - each is tested in the owning service's
  suite; e2e covers the whole path end-to-end.

**Test pyramid:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    UT["Unit: façade caches, BBO label, idempotent upsert"]
    WT["Widget: pages with faked client"]
    GL["Golden: design tokens"]
    E2E["e2e-ts Playwright: live BFF, UI-only"]
    UT --> WT
    WT --> GL
    WT --> E2E
```

## 10. Open Questions

- Transport bootstrap (sign-in + org-env picker inside the app shell vs.
  the platform library owning the whole flow) is not settled.
- Whether the app adds the two-way trader channel (WebSocket tier) for
  order-flow streams beyond the current SSE-only surfaces.
- Peg/iceberg parameters on the ticket, and cancel/amend + history on the
  blotter, wait on the corresponding gateway REST contract for the app.
- Golden-test fixtures need asset decisions (bundled fonts vs. system
  Inter) before they can be pinned.
